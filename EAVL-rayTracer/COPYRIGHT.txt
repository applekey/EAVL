This version of the file (4) is sorted to have schemes in the same
order as on the ColorBrewer site. Color patches are included in column
K. These were programmed by David P. Ryan as rectangles filled with
corresponding RGB colors and inserted in the cells as comments. Thank
you to David for the idea and initiative in making the color examples
available in the file.

The original ColorBrewer web site is at http://ColorBrewer.org
